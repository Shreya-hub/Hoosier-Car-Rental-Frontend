# Hoosier Car Rentals
The objective of the Project was to create a rental management system where users can rent out cars as
per their choice. This is a software program created expressly to handle automobile rental operations. It is
a one stop solution for full rental process which covers reservation and booking as well as billing, fleet
management. The software can be used to manage a fleet of rental automobiles and automate a number
of the manual processes involved in managing a car rental company, including keeping track of vehicle
availability, processing rental contracts, and creating invoices and reports
